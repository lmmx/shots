Versioned image hosting originally for [biochemistri.es](http://biochemistri.es), and since then begun to fulfil my other web projects.

- Functions in use documented in my devnotes repo wiki: [Image hosting on GitHub](https://github.com/lmmx/devnotes/wiki/Image-hosting-on-GitHub)

### Development

This will transition into a CDN at some point, more suitable for serving [statically generated] [permut.co](http://permut.co), and [spin.systems](http://spin.systems).
